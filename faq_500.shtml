<h2>GHC 5.00.2 Mini-FAQ</h2>

This page lists known problems for the 5.00.2 release, with workarounds.

<ul>

  <li>The interactive system complains about missing symbols like
  <tt>CC_LIST</tt> when loading previously compiled .o files.
  <p>
  This probably means the .o files in question were compiled for
  profiling
  (with <tt>-prof</tt>).  Workaround: recompile them without
  profiling.  We really ought to detect this situation and give a
  proper
  error message.
  <p>
  </li>

  <li>Not really a bug, but ... if the interactive system complains
  about
  missing symbols in a library, and you know those symbols should be
  supplied by a shared object (<tt>.so</tt>) file, remember that you
  can specify names of <tt>.so</tt>'s on the ghci command line.  These
  extra libraries are then also searched by the runtime linker.
  You can also use the <tt>-L</tt> and <tt>-l</tt> flags on the ghci
  command line, and they work in the usual way.
  </p>
  </li>

  <li>Linking a program causes the following error on Linux:
  <pre>
  /usr/bin/ld: cannot open -lgmp: No such file or directory
  </pre>
   The problem is that your system doesn't have the GMP library
  installed.  If this is a RedHat distribution, install the
  RedHat-supplied gmp-devel package, and the gmp package if you don't
  already have it.  There have been reports that installing the RedHat
  packages also works for SuSE (SuSE don't supply a shared gmp library).
  </li>

  <p><li><p>The <tt>-funbox-strict-fields</tt> flag sometimes gives wrong
  code.  
  <p>
  Workaround: don't use it.  Use of the usual <tt>-O</tt>
  optimisation bundle is still safe, though, since it doesn't
  include <tt>-funbox-strict-fields</tt>.  This will be fixed properly
  in 5.02.
  </p>
  </li>

  <li>When I try to start ghci (probably one I compiled myself) it says
  <pre>
   ghc-5.00.2: not built for interactive use
  </pre>
  To get ghci, you need to build GHC 5.00.2 with itself; the above
  message appears if you build it with 4.08.X, for example.  It'll
  still work fine for batch-mode compilation, though.</li>
  <p>

  <p><li><p>When I use a foreign function that takes or returns a float, it
  gives the wrong answer, or crashes.
  <p>You should use <a href="docs/5.00/set/sec-ffi.html"><tt>-#include</tt></a>.
  </li>

  <p><li><p>My program that uses a really large heap crashes on Windows.
  <p>For utterly horrible reasons, programs that use more than 128Mb of heap
  won't work when compiled dynamically on Windows (they should be fine
  statically compiled).
  </li>
  
  <p><li><p>GHC doesn't like filenames containing <tt>+</tt>.
  <p>Indeed not. You could change <tt>+</tt> to <tt>p</tt> or <tt>plus</tt>.
  </li>
  
  <p><li><p>My programs crashes on startup under Windows.
  <p>Use <tt>cygcheck</tt> to make sure it's not loading any DLLs it
  shouldn't be. My favourite is having a copy of <tt>gmp.dll</tt> in my
  Windows system directory. You'll need to remove such DLLs, or copy the
  ones you need into the same directory as the program, to make sure they're
  used in preference to DLLs in the system directories.
  </li>

  <p><li><p>I get screenfuls of errors from GCC when I compile my
  Haskell module.<p>If you're using the C back-end
  (which happens by default with <tt>-O</tt>, and is mandatory for
  <tt>-prof</tt>), then you can't use top-bit-set characters in identifiers,
  because they are not valid in C. GHC should be mangling them, and will in
  the next release. In the meantime, use the native backend
  (<tt>-fasm</tt>). D&eacute;sol&eacute.
  </li>

  <p><li><p>When I open a FIFO (named pipe) and try to read from it, I
  get EOF immediately.  <p>This is a consequence of the fact that GHC
  opens the FIFO in non-blocking mode.  The behaviour varies from OS to
  OS: on Linux and Solaris you can wait for a writer by doing an explicit
  <tt>threadWaitRead</tt> on
  the file descriptor (gotten from <tt>Posix.handleToFd</tt>) before
  the first read, but
  this doesn't work on FreeBSD.  A workaround for all systems is to open
  the FIFO for writing yourself, before (or at the same time as) opening
  it for reading.
  </li>

  <p><li><p>When I <tt>foreign import</tt> a function that returns
  <tt>char</tt> or <tt>short</tt>, I get garbage back.
  <p>This is a known bug, GHC currently doesn't mask out the more
  significant bits of the result.  It doesn't manifest with gcc 2.95,
  but apparently shows up with g++ and gcc 3.0.
  </li>
